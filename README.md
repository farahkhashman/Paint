# Paint
program similar to paint (but very basic features)

This project is used to develop and apply knowledge of graphics and listener methods. The 'paint' program allows the user to draw circles, rectangles and lines, as well as change their colour, delete and move them around. The user also has the ability to insert, resize and delete images and moving them around. 
The code utilises ArrayLists and Listener methods to implement the desired actions.
